# JSoleDICOM - DICOM Tools Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python-based DICOM tools to perform various tests and operations on DICOM functionality. These tools are designed to help users interact with PACS servers, DICOM images, and other DICOM-related tasks.

## Features

- Query DICOM Modality Worklist (MWL) from a PACS server using C-FIND operation. - In Progress
- Transfer DICOM images to and from PACS servers using C-STORE and C-GET/C-MOVE operations. - TBD
- Parse and display DICOM image headers and metadata. - TBD
- Modify DICOM image headers and save them to new files. -TBD
- Perform image processing and analysis on DICOM images. -TBD

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pynetdicom: `pip install pynetdicom`
- pydicom: `pip install pydicom`
- tkinter: usually comes pre-installed with Python, but if it's missing, you can install it using your package manager, e.g., `apt-get install python3-tk` for Debian-based systems or `pacman -S tk` for Arch-based systems.
